# TRIBE Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 2025
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1 Goals

- Deliver personalized, sequenced migration intelligence for any corridor in under 60 seconds
- Provide multi-modal access: dashboard, AI Q&A, audio briefings, and voice agent
- Support 5 languages at MVP (English, Yoruba, Hindi, Portuguese, Tagalog)
- Enable dynamic corridor research via AI agent (not limited to pre-computed corridors)
- Build trust through real source attribution from community experiences
- Achieve <5 second response times for Q&A and <1 second for voice interactions
- Complete functional MVP within 2-week hackathon timeline

### 1.2 Background Context

281 million people live outside their birth country, yet critical migration knowledge remains fragmented across WhatsApp groups, Reddit threads, and Facebook communities. Migrants spend months gathering information that could be synthesized in minutes. Existing solutions fail because they provide generic guidance without understanding the critical sequences and catch-22 traps that define real migration experiences.

TRIBE solves this by aggregating community wisdom into actionable, sequenced protocols—telling users not just what to do, but in what order, with attribution to real people who've made the journey. The platform serves users across their entire migration journey: planning, pre-departure, arrival, and settling—all in their native language.

The 2-week hackathon constraint requires ruthless prioritization. The MVP focuses on proving the core value proposition: synthesized corridor intelligence with multi-modal delivery.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

### 3.1 Overall UX Vision

TRIBE delivers a **calm, confident, and trustworthy** experience for users navigating the stress of international migration. The interface should feel like a knowledgeable friend who's already made the journey—direct, practical, and reassuring.

The neobrutalist aesthetic via RetroUI creates visual distinction from generic SaaS products, signaling that TRIBE is different: bold, honest, and human-centered rather than corporate and polished.

### 3.2 Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show the most critical next action prominently; details available on demand
- **Card-Based Protocol Display:** Each step as a distinct, actionable card with attribution
- **Conversational Q&A:** Natural language input with cited, synthesized responses
- **Audio-First Option:** Every screen offers audio alternative for hands-free consumption
- **Checklist Progression:** Satisfying visual feedback as users complete steps
- **Language-Native Experience:** Full localization, not just translated strings

### 3.3 Core Screens and Views

1. **Onboarding Flow** - Language → Origin → Destination → Stage → (Visa Type)
2. **Corridor Dashboard** - Protocol cards, progress tracker, quick stats
3. **Protocol Detail** - Expanded step with full attribution, tips, warnings
4. **AI Q&A Chat** - Conversational interface with source citations
5. **Audio Briefing Player** - Playback controls, transcript toggle
6. **Voice Agent Interface** - Push-to-talk or wake word activation
7. **Profile/Settings** - Language, corridor, stage management

### 3.4 Accessibility

**WCAG AA** compliance target:
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus indicators
- Alt text for images
- Audio transcripts available

### 3.5 Branding

- **Visual Style:** RetroUI neobrutalist aesthetic - bold borders, chunky buttons, honest aesthetic
- **Color Palette:** High contrast, accessible colors (specific palette TBD by UX)
- **Typography:** Clear, readable fonts suitable for multiple languages including Yoruba, Hindi, Tagalog
- **Tone:** Confident, practical, warm, peer-to-peer (not corporate)
- **Logo/Identity:** "TRIBE" wordmark with diaspora/network motif (TBD)

### 3.6 Target Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Mobile-first design, works on all screen sizes
- Primary: Mobile web (iPhone, Android browsers)
- Secondary: Desktop web
- Native apps: Out of scope for MVP

### 4.4 CopilotKit + AG-UI Integration

**Reference:** [CopilotKit Docs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/) | [AG-UI Protocol](https://www.copilotkit.ai/ag-ui) | [Mastra Integration](https://mastra.ai/docs/frameworks/agentic-uis/copilotkit)

CopilotKit with AG-UI (Agent-User Interaction protocol) provides the agentic UI layer for TRIBE:

**Core Packages:**
```
@copilotkit/react-core     # React integration
@copilotkit/react-ui       # Chat components, generative UI
@copilotkit/runtime        # Server runtime
@ag-ui/mastra              # Mastra agent bridge
```

**Key Capabilities Used:**

| Capability | TRIBE Usage |
|------------|-------------|
| **CopilotChat** | Q&A interface with streaming responses |
| **Shared State** | Bidirectional sync of corridor/stage/language with agents |
| **Generative UI** | Dynamic protocol cards generated by synthesis agent |
| **Runtime Context** | Pass user profile to agent on every interaction |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | User approval before agent actions (e.g., corridor refresh) |

**Generative UI Pattern for Protocol Cards:**
```
Agent returns: { type: "protocol-step", title: "...", warnings: [...], attribution: {...} }
Frontend renders: <ProtocolCard> component from RetroUI library
```

**Architecture Reference:** CopilotKit's [Travel Planner example](https://www.copilotkit.ai/examples) is architecturally similar to TRIBE.

### Epic 7: Task Board (Kanban)

**Goal:** Create a visual task management system that integrates with the existing protocol system, allowing users to track their migration tasks using a familiar Trello-style Kanban board. Tasks can originate from protocol steps or be created manually, providing a personal action-oriented view of the migration journey.

**Key Innovation:** Unlike generic to-do apps, TRIBE's Task Board is journey-aware and protocol-integrated. Protocol steps serve as AI-generated reference guides, while tasks represent the user's personal action items. This separation allows users to maintain their own workflow while still benefiting from the structured guidance protocols provide.

---

5. Empty state for each column with helpful messaging
6. Column headers show task count
7. Board is journey-scoped (shows tasks for active corridor only)

---

6. Keyboard shortcut for quick task creation (Cmd/Ctrl + N)
7. Cancel and save buttons with proper states

---

#### Story 7.6: Two-Way Protocol-Task Sync

**As a** user,
**I want** task completion to sync with protocol progress,
**so that** completing a task marks the related protocol step as done and vice versa.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Moving task to "Done" column marks linked protocol step as completed
2. Marking protocol step complete moves linked task to "Done" column

6. Created/updated timestamps displayed
7. Close modal saves changes (auto-save or explicit save button)

---

#### Story 7.9: Task Board Journey Switching

**As a** user,
**I want** my task board to update when I switch journeys,
**so that** I see tasks relevant to my current migration corridor.

## 8. Next Steps

### 8.1 UX Expert Prompt

> Review the TRIBE PRD at `docs/prd.md`, focusing on Section 3 (UI Design Goals) and the story acceptance criteria for user-facing features. Create a detailed Frontend Specification using the front-end-spec template that defines the visual design system, component library usage (RetroUI), screen layouts, interaction patterns, and responsive breakpoints. Pay special attention to the multi-language requirements and the neobrutalist aesthetic direction.

### 8.2 Architect Prompt

> Review the TRIBE PRD at `docs/prd.md`, focusing on Section 4 (Technical Assumptions) and all epic/story details. Create a comprehensive Architecture Document using the fullstack-architecture template that defines the system architecture, Convex schema design, API integration patterns (including Firecrawl for web scraping), Mastra agent configuration, AI pipeline design (RAG, synthesis, translation), and deployment architecture. Ensure the architecture supports the 2-week hackathon timeline with appropriate trade-offs.
