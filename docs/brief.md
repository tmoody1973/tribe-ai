# Project Brief: TRIBE - The Diaspora Intelligence Network

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 2024
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## Executive Summary

**TRIBE** is an AI-powered platform that aggregates and synthesizes diaspora community knowledge, delivering personalized, sequenced intelligence for any migration corridor—in the user's native language.

**The Problem:** 281 million people live outside their birth country. When they plan to move (e.g., Nigeria to Germany), critical information is trapped in WhatsApp groups, scattered Reddit threads, and Facebook communities. It takes months to gather knowledge that locals have instantly. Existing resources are almost always in English or the destination language, creating an additional barrier.

**The Solution:** An intelligent platform that transforms fragmented community wisdom into actionable, sequenced protocols—telling users not just *what* to do, but *in what order*, with real attribution from people who've made the journey. Fully localized to the user's preferred language.

**Target Market:** Prospective migrants, recent arrivals, and established diaspora members across global migration corridors.

**Key Value Proposition:** Three months of hard-won diaspora knowledge, delivered in 60 seconds—in your language.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Migration knowledge is fundamentally broken:

1. **Fragmentation** — Critical information is scattered across WhatsApp groups, Reddit threads, Facebook communities, YouTube comments, and country-specific forums
2. **Catch-22 Loops** — Bureaucratic dependencies create traps (e.g., need bank account to pay rent, need address to open bank account, need rental contract to get address registration)
3. **Generic Guidance** — Official sources and existing guides provide requirements but not *sequences* or *hacks*
4. **Time Decay** — Information becomes outdated as policies change, but old advice persists
5. **No Attribution** — Users can't verify if advice comes from someone who actually completed the process
6. **Language Barriers** — Most resources are in English or destination language, excluding non-fluent speakers

### Impact of the Problem

- **Time lost:** Migrants spend 3-6 months gathering information that could be synthesized in minutes
- **Money lost:** Wrong sequences lead to wasted deposits, missed deadlines, duplicate fees
- **Stress and anxiety:** Navigating bureaucracy in a new country without clear guidance
- **Failed migrations:** Some give up due to preventable complications
- **Repeated mistakes:** Each migrant rediscovers the same pitfalls independently
- **Exclusion:** Non-English speakers have even less access to community knowledge

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| **ChatGPT/AI Assistants** | Generic training data, no corridor-specific sequences, no attribution |
| **Reddit/Facebook** | Information exists but fragmented, no synthesis, hard to search, mostly English |
| **Government Sites** | Official requirements only, no practical sequences or community hacks |
| **Relocation Agencies** | Expensive ($5-10K), not accessible to most migrants |
| **Expat Blogs** | Individual experiences, not aggregated patterns, usually English-only |

### Urgency

- Global migration is increasing (281M and growing)
- AI technology now enables the synthesis that was previously impossible
- First-mover advantage in corridor-specific intelligence
- 2-week hackathon window to build and demonstrate MVP

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

TRIBE is a **Diaspora Intelligence Network** that:

1. **Onboards** users with language preference and corridor selection
2. **Ingests** community knowledge from Reddit, YouTube, forums, and structured data APIs
3. **Synthesizes** patterns using Claude to extract sequences, warnings, and hacks
4. **Delivers** personalized, sequenced protocols with real attribution—in the user's language
5. **Updates** in real-time using Perplexity for policy changes and freshness
6. **Speaks** to users via localized voice agent and audio briefings

### Key Differentiators

| Traditional Guides | TRIBE |
|-------------------|-------|
| "Here are 5 bank options" | "Do N26 first—here's why" |
| "You need to register your address" | "Book Bürgeramt NOW, Kreuzberg not Mitte" |
| Generic tips | Named sources: "Ada, 2024" with links |
| Static content | Time-sensitive, personalized intelligence |
| English-only | Native language experience |

### The "Amara Moment" (North Star Experience)

A Nigerian software engineer lands in Berlin. She opens TRIBE. The app greets her in Yoruba (her preferred language from onboarding). It asks: "Have you arrived in Germany?" She taps yes.

What appears: **"You have 14 days. Here's the exact order."**

Not tips. An exact sequence with specific names, addresses, and warnings from Nigerians who landed before her. She puts in her earbuds and listens to a 5-minute audio briefing—in Yoruba—while waiting for her Uber. The voice agent is ready to answer her questions, also in Yoruba.

In 60 seconds, she learns what took others months to figure out—without language being a barrier.

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

1. **Technology timing** — LLMs can now extract patterns from unstructured community content AND translate fluently
2. **Data availability** — Community knowledge exists but hasn't been synthesized
3. **Clear pain point** — Every migrant experiences this problem personally
4. **Moat potential** — Aggregated, attributed sequences are defensible
5. **Multi-modal delivery** — Dashboard + AI Q&A + Voice briefings meet users where they are
6. **Language inclusion** — Serving users in their native language expands market significantly

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

1. **Onboarding Flow**
   - Language selection (first screen)
   - Origin country selection
   - Destination country selection
   - Current stage (Planning / Pre-departure / Arrived / Settled)
   - Visa type (if known)
   - App fully localizes to selected language

2. **Corridor Dashboard**
   - Synthesized intelligence for origin → destination paths
   - Arrival Protocol: sequenced steps with attribution
   - Cost of living comparison, visa requirements baseline
   - Progress tracking (checklist of completed steps)
   - **Fully localized to user's language**

3. **AI Q&A**
   - Ask questions, get answers from community knowledge
   - RAG over ingested content + Claude synthesis
   - Perplexity fallback for real-time/policy questions
   - Source attribution on every answer
   - **Chat in user's preferred language**
   - Translate source quotes on-the-fly if needed

4. **Audio Briefings**
   - NPR-style updates personalized to user's stage
   - ElevenLabs TTS for natural voice delivery
   - Daily/weekly briefings based on journey phase
   - Hands-free consumption (commute, airport, etc.)
   - **Briefings generated in user's language**

5. **Dynamic Corridor Agent**
   - Mastra-based agent researches ANY corridor on demand
   - Not limited to pre-computed corridors
   - Caches results for future users
   - Refreshes stale data automatically

6. **Voice Agent (Conversational)**
   - Interactive Q&A via voice
   - ElevenLabs STT + Claude + TTS pipeline
   - Hands-free access to intelligence
   - **Speaks and understands user's language**

### Localization Architecture (Hybrid Approach)

| Content Type | Approach | Technology |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| **UI Strings** (buttons, labels, nav) | Pre-translated JSON files | next-intl |
| **Dynamic Content** (protocols, Q&A) | AI translation at runtime | Claude (during synthesis) |
| **Audio Briefings** | AI-generated scripts in target language | Claude → ElevenLabs TTS |
| **Voice Agent** | Real-time multilingual conversation | ElevenLabs STT → Claude → ElevenLabs TTS |

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// User profile stores language preference
const user = { language: 'yo', corridor: 'NG-DE' };

// Protocol synthesis includes language instruction
const protocol = await synthesizeProtocol({
  corridor: user.corridor,
  outputLanguage: user.language, // Claude outputs in Yoruba
});

// Audio briefing generated in user's language
const script = await generateBriefingScript({
  user,
  language: user.language, // Script written in Yoruba
});

// ElevenLabs TTS with language-appropriate voice
const audio = await elevenlabs.textToSpeech({
  text: script,
  voice: getVoiceForLanguage(user.language),
});
```

**Why Hybrid:**
- No extra translation API needed (Claude handles it during synthesis)
- UI strings are static → pre-translate once with next-intl
- Dynamic content changes per user → translate at runtime
- Single source of truth for language preference in user profile

### Supported Languages (MVP)

| Language | Code | Primary Corridors | ElevenLabs Voice |
|----------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **English** | en | Universal, UK→AU | Default |
| **Yoruba** | yo | Nigeria→Germany, Nigeria→UK | TBD |
| **Hindi** | hi | India→Canada, India→UAE | Available |
| **Portuguese** | pt | Brazil→Portugal | Available |
| **Tagalog** | tl | Philippines→UAE, Philippines→Canada | TBD |

*Language support scales as corridors expand*

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

| Type | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| **Timeline** | 2-week hackathon sprint for MVP |
| **Budget** | Free tiers + minimal paid APIs during development |
| **Team** | Solo developer (augmented by AI tooling) |
| **Technical** | Must use specified stack (Next.js, Convex, etc.) |

### Key Assumptions

- Reddit API remains accessible for research purposes
- Community content contains sufficient signal for sequence extraction
- Users are willing to share their corridor/stage/language for personalization
- ElevenLabs supports quality voices for MVP languages (Yoruba, Hindi, Portuguese, Tagalog)
- Claude can reliably extract patterns AND translate fluently in single pass
- Perplexity API provides accurate real-time policy information
- Users prefer synthesized protocols over raw community content
- Translation quality via Claude is sufficient for actionable guidance

---

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Data Quality** | Poor protocols if source content is insufficient | Start with high-volume corridors (NG→DE), validate quality before expanding |
| **API Rate Limits** | Can't research corridors at scale | Aggressive caching, prioritize popular corridors |
| **Outdated Information** | Users follow stale advice | Perplexity freshness layer, timestamp all sources, flag old content |
| **Attribution Accuracy** | Misattributed quotes damage trust | Link to original sources, allow user flagging |
| **Voice Latency** | Poor UX if voice agent is slow | ElevenLabs optimized pipeline, fallback to text |
| **Scope Creep** | 2-week timeline insufficient | Strict MVP scope, defer all non-essential features |
| **Translation Quality** | Poor translations for critical instructions | Claude handles translation + synthesis together for context; user feedback loop |
| **Voice Quality** | ElevenLabs may not support all languages well | Test voice quality early, fallback to text for unsupported languages |

### Open Questions

1. How do we handle corridors with minimal community content?
2. What's the refresh frequency for cached protocols?
3. How do we verify that a source actually completed the process they describe?
4. Should free tier users see attributed sources or just synthesized content?
5. How do we handle contradictory advice from community sources?
6. Does ElevenLabs have quality voices for Yoruba and Tagalog?
7. Should we translate source quotes or keep original + translation?
8. How do we handle code-switching (mixing languages) in community content?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Legal considerations for scraping/ingesting community content
- Optimal embedding strategy for corridor-specific retrieval
- Voice agent conversation design patterns
- B2B pricing validation with potential customers
- Competitive response risk if incumbents copy approach
- ElevenLabs voice availability and quality per language
- Claude translation accuracy for bureaucratic/legal terminology
